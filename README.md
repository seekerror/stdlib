# stdlib

The `stdlib` packages contain general-purpose functionality and standard library extensions, using generics introduced in go 1.18.

Packages:
 
* `lang`: fundamental concepts, such as iterators and associated operations.
  
* `container`: basic datastructures, notably red-green search tree.

* `util`: various utilities. As a convention, extensions to a standard library package `lib` are in `util/libx`.
